# Jetbot environment installation in Ubuntu
## WLS or VirtualBox
The Windows Subsystem for Linux is a little more complicated (more steps). Installing a virtual machine using Virtual Box is easier, because it already comes with an X-server
### WSL Installation
If you want to use WSL then follow the next two tutorials
1. [WSL installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
2. [Using WSL 2 with X-Server â€” Linux on Windows](https://medium.com/javarevisited/using-wsl-2-with-x-server-linux-on-windows-a372263533c3)
### Virtual Box installation
1. Download and install Virtual Box from [virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
2. After installing it restart your computer, otherwise you won't be able to install a 64 bit OS 
3. Download ubuntu from [ubuntu.com/download](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
4. Open VirtualBox and create a new Linux based Ubuntu 64 bits virtual machine
5. The RAM size can be changed later, disk size also can be changed, but it's better if you choose a fixed size one
